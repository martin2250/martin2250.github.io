title: About me
---

My name is Martin, I live in Germany and I study Physics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/).  
My father introduced me to electronics very early on. Since then I've also taught myself programming (C# mostly, later C/C++ for embedded and a few others along the way). My CNC (Shapeoko 2 clone) is a pretty recent addition to my toolbox, but has enabled many projects with more to come surely.

On this website I'll document/showcase some of my future projects, but I don't see any regular content coming.
