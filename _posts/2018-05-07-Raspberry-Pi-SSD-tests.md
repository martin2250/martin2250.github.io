I've been using a Raspberry Pi 3B together with a HifiBerry Amp and the [MoodeAudio distribution](http://moodeaudio.org/) to play music.
Using it just for that seems like a waste of a perfectly good Pi, so I'm adding more services to it.

One service in particular is a time series database for monitoring different metrics around the house (for now the gas meter reading and weather data from the garden).
